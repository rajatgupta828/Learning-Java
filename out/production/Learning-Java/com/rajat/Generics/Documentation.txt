Generics is used for validations.

We can define in the class :
    Team<T>{

    }

Generics can be then validated as well by providing the Upper bound :

public class Team<T extends Player> {

}
Interfaces can be also provided as the upper bounds.
Extend from 1 class and multiple inheritence.
Multiple bounds can be provided using Interfaces
public class Team<T extends Player & Coach & Manager> {

}

coach and manager would be interfaces.
and then can be used.
