Interfaces are by default abstract.

In interfaces all the methods are abstract, but we can define absract and non-abstract classes both in the
abstract classes.

- Can not instantiate abstract class.
- Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
- "is a" and "can" relation decides b/w interface and abstract class.
bird is a animal - bird can extend animal class
bird can fly - it should be in interface.

- interface should have variables that can be only final and static, not case in abstract.
 - interface methods are always public
